Installation
============

To run IRDAP the user needs to have Python 3.6 or higher installed. 

Installing IRDAP
----------------

IRDAP is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/irdap/>`_ and can be installed by simply typing in a terminal:
::

   pip install irdap

Because IRDAP is being actively developed, it is recommended to regularly check for updates through:

::

   pip install irdap --upgrade
   
and install the latest version. To be kept up-to-date via e-mail, sign up to the :ref:`mailing list <Mailing list>`.

The most recent release of IRDAP is also available for download from the 
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/robvanholstein/IRDAP/releases/latest/>`_. 

Testing the installation
------------------------

In the terminal, try to access the basic help and the version of IRDAP:
::
 
   irdap --help
 
   irdap --version

If that works, IRDAP is most likely installed correctly. 

As a next step, it is recommended to run the :ref:`example reduction <Example reduction>`.
